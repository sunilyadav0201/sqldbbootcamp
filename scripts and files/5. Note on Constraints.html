<h4>Constraints </h4>

<p>In the next lecture on creating tables we will cover basic constraints, however take note that at the end of this section we will have individual lectures specifically focused on the details of the following constraints:</p>

<ul><li>CHECK Constraint</li><li>NOT NULL Constraint</li><li>UNIQUE Constraint</li></ul>

<p>So feel free to skip to one of those lectures if you're interested in finding out more about those particular constraints! Otherwise enjoy the next lecture where we will learn how to use <strong>CREATE TABLE </strong></p>
